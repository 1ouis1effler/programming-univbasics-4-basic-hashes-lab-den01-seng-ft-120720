# Intro to Hashes Lab

## Learning Goals

- Build simple hashes.

## Introduction

It's time to practice what we've learned about Ruby hashes. In this lab, your
task is to implement a set of three methods. Each method will require you to
complete some basic hash creation. 

## Instructions

Code your solution in the `lib/intro_to_ruby_hashes_lab.rb` file. Use `learn`
and follow the test suite messages as you work through your solution.

1. Create a method called `new_hash` that creates and returns a new, empty
   hash.

2. Create a method called `my_hash` that returns a valid hash. This hash should
   have at least one key/value pair of your choice.

3. Create a method called `pioneer` that returns a hash. This hash should have a
   key that is a symbol `:name` and whose value is a string, `'Grace Hopper'`.

## Conclusion

Hashes are an essential data type that we will use frequently. Now that you've
practiced the basics of creating hashes, we will practice reading and updating
them.
